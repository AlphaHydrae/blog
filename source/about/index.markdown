Welcome to my blog.

This is a coding journal which I use to document some of the blood spilt during my technical journey to the edges of the intarweb. It contains condensed tutorials which I use as a reference for myself, and may occasionally include my opinions about the latest tech I found to play with. Be advised that updates will be sporadic.

As for myself, I'm a Software Engineer, self-styled *Code Warrior* and *Professional Geek*. When I'm not working, I'm also many other things from an avid reader to a decent pianist and an amateur chess player. For a serious profile, go to [LinkedIn](http://ch.linkedin.com/in/simonoulevay).
